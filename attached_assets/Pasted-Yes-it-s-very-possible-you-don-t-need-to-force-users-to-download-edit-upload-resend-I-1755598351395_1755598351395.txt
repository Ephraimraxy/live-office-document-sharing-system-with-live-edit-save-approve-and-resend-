Yes ✅ it’s very possible — you don’t need to force users to **download → edit → upload → resend**. Instead, you can build a **live, in-browser editing workflow**. Here are a few approaches:

---

### 🔹 1. Use Embedded Online Editors (Quickest)

* **Google Docs / Office 365 integration**

  * Store your docs in Google Drive or OneDrive.
  * Generate a **share link with API** for edit-only permissions.
  * Users edit in the browser, changes auto-save, and your system tracks workflow (sign, approve, notify).

  ⚡ Pros: No editor to build, fully live editing, strong collaboration tools.
  ⚠️ Cons: Tied to Google/Microsoft ecosystem, limited control over UI.

---

### 🔹 2. Build a Custom Rich-Text/Doc Editor

* Use a JavaScript-based editor library:

  * **Quill.js** (simple rich text, good for lightweight docs).
  * **TinyMCE / CKEditor 5** (enterprise-level editors with track changes, comments, export to DOCX/PDF).
  * **Slate.js / ProseMirror** (more flexible, good for custom workflows).

* Workflow:

  * Users open a doc → edit live in the browser.
  * Changes auto-save to Firebase/your database.
  * No downloads; you can version changes automatically.

  ⚡ Pros: Full control, works like Google Docs inside your app.
  ⚠️ Cons: More dev work, need to handle collaborative editing & conflict resolution.

---

### 🔹 3. Real-Time Collaborative Editing (like Google Docs)

* Use **Operational Transform (OT)** or **CRDTs** for multi-user editing.

  * Firebase Realtime DB or Firestore (with Yjs or Automerge) works well.
  * Each keystroke syncs across clients → live collaborative editing.
  * Add workflow buttons (Sign, Approve, Resend).

  ⚡ Pros: True real-time teamwork.
  ⚠️ Cons: More complex to implement (but very powerful).

---

### 🔹 4. Document Signing Without Download

* Integrate **eSignature APIs**:

  * **DocuSign**, **HelloSign**, or build your own with canvas signature pads.
  * Sign directly in the browser → attach signature metadata → save version → auto-notify next office.

---

✅ So yes, you can build a **"live edit–save–sign–resend"** workflow entirely inside your web app — no downloads.

---

👉 Do you want me to **design a React + Firebase demo** where users can:

* Upload a doc → edit it in-browser (with TinyMCE/Quill) → auto-save versions → sign → resend to next role with live notifications?
